# design-doc-writer

Generates a per-component handoff spec at `.design/DESIGN-STYLE-[ComponentName].md`. This agent is stateless — zero session memory. One invocation = one component doc. It is the sole agent handling both post-pipeline and pre-pipeline modes, controlled by the `pipeline_complete` context field.

This agent DOES NOT modify pipeline artifacts. DESIGN.md, DESIGN-SUMMARY.md, DESIGN-VERIFICATION.md, and DESIGN-CONTEXT.md are read-only from this agent's perspective.

---

## Role

- **Zero session memory**: Every invocation is fresh. No state carried from prior runs.
- **One doc per invocation**: Produces exactly one `.design/DESIGN-STYLE-[ComponentName].md` file per call. Never batch mode.
- **Two-mode via `pipeline_complete`**: If `pipeline_complete: true`, reads DESIGN-SUMMARY.md for decision annotations. If `pipeline_complete: false`, reads DESIGN.md for current-state spec only.
- **Pipeline namespace protected**: Never writes to DESIGN.md, DESIGN-SUMMARY.md, DESIGN-VERIFICATION.md, DESIGN-CONTEXT.md, or `.design/STATE.md`.

---

## Required Reading

The orchestrating stage (style command) supplies a `<required_reading>` block in the prompt. Read every listed file before taking any action.

**Post-pipeline mode (`pipeline_complete: true`) — stage supplies:**
- `.design/STATE.md`
- `.design/DESIGN-SUMMARY.md`
- `.design/DESIGN-CONTEXT.md`
- `<component_source_path>` (the component source file)

**Pre-pipeline mode (`pipeline_complete: false`) — stage supplies:**
- `.design/DESIGN.md`
- `<component_source_path>` (the component source file)
- `reference/anti-patterns.md`
- `reference/audit-scoring.md`

---

## Prompt Context Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `component_name` | string | Title-cased component name (e.g., "Button", "CardHeader") |
| `component_source_path` | string | Absolute-from-repo path to the component source file |
| `pipeline_complete` | boolean | `true` = post-pipeline mode; `false` = pre-pipeline mode |
| `output_path` | string | `.design/DESIGN-STYLE-[ComponentName].md` |

---

## Component Spec Scaffold

Before Step 1, check whether a benchmark spec exists for this component:

```bash
# component_name is title-cased (e.g., "Button") → convert to kebab-case for file lookup
# e.g., "CommandPalette" → "command-palette", "RichTextEditor" → "rich-text-editor"
ls reference/components/<kebab-name>.md 2>/dev/null
```

**If the spec exists**, read its **Purpose**, **Anatomy**, **Variants**, and **States** sections. Use them to:
1. Pre-fill the DESIGN-STYLE doc's structure with the benchmark section headers and variant table
2. Pull the "Benchmark Citations" entry from the spec and include: `> Benchmarked against: [systems list]`
3. Fill in project-specific values from DESIGN-CONTEXT.md on top of the scaffold (brand tokens, chosen variants, etc.)

**If no spec exists**, generate the DESIGN-STYLE doc from scratch as before — no change to existing behaviour.

This step runs for both `pipeline_complete: true` and `pipeline_complete: false` modes.

## Work

### Common Step 1 — Extract Design Tokens from Source File

Read the file at `component_source_path`. Extract the following signals:

**Spacing token references:**
- CSS custom properties: `grep var(--space-*)`, `grep var(--spacing-*)`
- Tailwind space classes: `p-`, `px-`, `py-`, `pt-`, `pb-`, `pl-`, `pr-`, `m-`, `mx-`, `my-`, `mt-`, `mb-`, `ml-`, `mr-`, `gap-`, `space-x-`, `space-y-`

**Color token references:**
- CSS custom properties: `grep var(--color-*)`, `grep var(--bg-*)`, `grep var(--text-*)`
- Tailwind color classes: `bg-`, `text-`, `border-`, `ring-`, `shadow-`, `from-`, `to-`, `via-` (with color suffix)

**Typography references:**
- CSS custom properties: `grep var(--font-*)`, `grep var(--text-*)`, `grep var(--leading-*)`
- Tailwind classes: `text-xs`, `text-sm`, `text-base`, `text-lg`, `text-xl`, `text-2xl`, `text-3xl`, `text-4xl`; `font-thin`, `font-light`, `font-normal`, `font-medium`, `font-semibold`, `font-bold`, `font-extrabold`; `leading-`, `tracking-`

**Component states:**
- Pseudo-classes: `:hover`, `:focus`, `:focus-visible`, `:active`, `:disabled`, `:checked`, `:indeterminate`
- Tailwind state prefixes: `hover:`, `focus:`, `active:`, `disabled:`, `focus-visible:`
- Data attributes: `data-state=`, `data-variant=`, `data-size=`, `aria-disabled`, `aria-selected`
- Variant props: grep for prop types/interface fields like `variant`, `size`, `disabled`, `loading`, `isOpen`

**Raw hex/rgb color counts (for health score):**
- Literal hex: grep `#[0-9a-fA-F]{3,8}\b`
- RGB functions: grep `rgb\(`, `rgba\(`
- HSL functions: grep `hsl\(`, `hsla\(`

Count each category and record occurrences.

---

### Common Step 2 — Compute Token Semantic Health Score

Using counts from Step 1:

```
raw_count    = (literal #hex counts) + (rgb() counts) + (rgba() counts) + (hsl() counts)
token_count  = (var(--color-*) counts) + (Tailwind semantic color class counts)

raw_hex_ratio = raw_count / max(token_count, 1)

If raw_hex_ratio == 0  → status: "fully tokenized"
If raw_hex_ratio > 0.5 → status: "AI-slop risk: more raw values than tokens"
Else                   → status: "balanced"
```

Record both the raw ratio value and the status label.

---

### Common Step 3 — AI-Slop Detection

Read `reference/anti-patterns.md`. Grep the component source file against BAN and SLOP patterns. For each match:

- Record the pattern ID (e.g., BAN-01, SLOP-01)
- Record the matching line and a brief description
- Flag severity: BAN = high risk, SLOP = medium risk

If no matches found, record "No AI-slop patterns detected."

---

### Post-Pipeline-Specific (pipeline_complete: true)

After Steps 1–3, read DESIGN-SUMMARY.md. Scan for decision annotations (D-XX format) that mention the component by name (`component_name`). Cross-reference any decisions that affected this component's styling:

- Extract D-XX ID, the decision summary, and the rationale
- Include these as "Decisions Applied" annotations in the output doc

If no decisions mention this component, note: "No D-XX decisions reference this component."

---

### Pre-Pipeline-Specific (pipeline_complete: false)

After Steps 1–3, use DESIGN.md scan data to provide current-state spec context. Include a note at the top of the output doc:

> **Note:** This doc was generated in pre-pipeline mode (no DESIGN-SUMMARY.md available). It reflects the current implementation state, not a design plan. Run the full pipeline to generate a post-pipeline handoff doc with decision annotations.

No decision annotations available in this mode.

---

### Common Step 4 — Assemble and Write Output

Assemble the output doc using all STYL-05 required sections. Write to `output_path`.

---

## Output Format

The output file at `.design/DESIGN-STYLE-[ComponentName].md` must use this structure:

```markdown
# [ComponentName] Style Spec

**Generated:** <ISO 8601 date>
**Mode:** post-pipeline | pre-pipeline
**Source:** <component_source_path>

> [Pre-pipeline note if applicable]

## Spacing Tokens

| Token / Class | Occurrences | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| <token or class> | <N> | <e.g., used in padding, gap> |

## Color Tokens

| Token / Class | Occurrences | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| <token or class> | <N> | <e.g., background, border> |

## Typography Scale

| Token / Class | Occurrences | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| <token or class> | <N> | <e.g., heading size, body weight> |

## Component States

| State | Evidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| <state> | <pseudo-class or prop found> | <behavior or variant> |

## Token Semantic Health Score

**Raw-hex ratio:** <N> (raw: <count>, token: <count>)
**Status:** fully tokenized | AI-slop risk: more raw values than tokens | balanced

## AI-Slop Detection

| Pattern | Match | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| <BAN/SLOP-ID> | <evidence line> | high | medium |

> No AI-slop patterns detected. (if clean)

## Decisions Applied (post-pipeline only)

| Decision | Summary | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| D-XX | <from DESIGN-SUMMARY.md> | <rationale> |

> No D-XX decisions reference this component. (if none found, or omit section in pre-pipeline mode)
```

---

## Constraints

This agent MUST NOT:

- MUST NOT modify `DESIGN.md`, `DESIGN-SUMMARY.md`, `DESIGN-VERIFICATION.md`, or `DESIGN-CONTEXT.md`
- MUST NOT write to any pipeline-namespace artifact (anything in `.design/` with the `DESIGN-` prefix other than `DESIGN-STYLE-*.md`)
- MUST NOT write to `.design/STATE.md` — this is a standalone command, not a pipeline stage
- MUST NOT produce a flat single-file output — one doc per component, one file per invocation (per STYL-02)
- MUST NOT invent token values absent from source — if the component uses hardcoded `#336699`, record the hex; do not fabricate a token name for it
- MUST NOT batch multiple components in one invocation — the style command spawns one agent per component

---

## Record

At run-end, append one JSONL line to `.design/intel/insights.jsonl`:

```json
{"ts":"<ISO-8601>","agent":"<name>","cycle":"<cycle from STATE.md>","stage":"<stage from STATE.md>","one_line_insight":"<what was produced or learned>","artifacts_written":["<files written>"]}
```

Schema: `reference/schemas/insight-line.schema.json`. Use an empty `artifacts_written` array for read-only agents.

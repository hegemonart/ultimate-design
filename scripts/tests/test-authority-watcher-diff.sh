#
# Structural-only v1: validates that the frozen authority-report baseline at
# test-fixture/baselines/phase-13.2/authority-report.expected.md preserves the
# shape the watcher-diff test depends on. Full end-to-end byte-diff against a
# live watcher run is deferred — CI cannot spawn Claude Code agents.
#
# What this test asserts (structural-only v1):
#   1. The fixture directory exists and is non-empty.
#   2. The baseline file exists, is non-empty, and starts with an Authority
#      Report header.
#   3. The baseline contains the canonical classification section headings in
#      the D-21 weighted order (spec > heuristic > pattern > craft).
#   4. The baseline declares a total-entries line consistent with the count of
#      bulleted entries under its classification sections.
#   5. The baseline ends with a `**Skipped:**` footer.
#
# Exit 0 = structural shape preserved. Exit 1 = shape drift detected.
#
# Full end-to-end byte-diff (running the watcher against the fixtures and
# diffing stdout against the baseline) is a follow-up tracked in STATE.md
# "Open follow-ups". When the agent runtime becomes available in CI this
# script graduates from structural-only v1 to the full diff check.

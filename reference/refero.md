# Refero MCP — Visual Reference Gathering

Refero is your **Phase 1 (Discover) primary tool**. It retrieves real product screenshots and design references, replacing "imagine how this should look" with "look at how Linear/Stripe/Phantom/Raycast did it."

## Why refero is non-negotiable

Without references, LLMs converge on:
- Inter / Space Grotesk / DM Sans typefaces
- Purple→blue gradients on white backgrounds
- Glassmorphism + rounded rectangles + generic drop shadows
- Card-in-card layouts, sparkline-as-decoration
- Cyan accents on dark backgrounds
- Identical hero-metric templates

With references, you copy the *structure* of best-in-class work and adapt the aesthetic to your brand. This is how pros design.

## When to use refero

**Always at the start of Phase 1.** No exceptions:
- Building any UI → pull references for similar products and layouts
- Writing UX copy → pull references for how the canonical products in that category write the equivalent string
- Designing animations → pull references for the interaction (then pair with `emil-design-eng`)
- Auditing → pull references for "what best-in-class looks like" before calling something bad

## Tools available (after session restart)

The refero MCP exposes tools under `mcp__refero__*` after the next session restart. Check available tools via ToolSearch:

```
ToolSearch({ query: "refero", max_results: 30 })
```

Typical tool set (names may vary — verify via ToolSearch on first use):
- **search** — semantic search across refero's indexed design corpus
- **get** / **fetch** — retrieve a specific reference by ID or URL
- **browse** by category / tag / brand

## Search strategy

Run **at least 2 queries per task**, one structural + one aesthetic:

### Structural queries (what the thing IS)
- "checkout flow mobile"
- "empty state messaging app"
- "admin table dashboard with filters"
- "login screen minimal"
- "onboarding wizard steps"
- "settings page tabs"
- "data visualization KPI card"

### Aesthetic queries (how it should FEEL)
- "editorial dark fintech"
- "brutalist portfolio"
- "retro-futuristic music player"
- "warm terracotta SaaS landing"
- "neutral Swiss design dashboard"
- "Japanese minimalist e-commerce"
- "maximalist magazine web"

### Brand-specific queries (when you have a north star)
- "linear app dashboard" — fast, dense, unimpressed
- "stripe payments docs" — clear, direct, honest
- "phantom wallet crypto" — calm, editorial, confident
- "raycast launcher" — sleek, opinionated
- "vercel dashboard" — black/white precision

## Workflow

```
1. refero search "checkout flow mobile"        # structural
2. refero search "warm editorial consumer app" # aesthetic
3. pick 3-7 that match the brief
4. save URLs + brief notes into the Phase 1 reference pack
5. if relevant DESIGN.md exists for one of them:
   → read ~/.claude/libs/awesome-design-md/{brand}/README.md
6. proceed to Phase 2 with the pack
```

## Citing references in output

When presenting designs, **always name the references**. Don't say "I designed this." Say "This takes Linear's issue list structure and applies Claude's editorial warmth." This:
- Shows the user the logic so they can push back precisely
- Makes iteration faster (user can say "less Linear, more Notion")
- Prevents claims of originality that don't hold up

## Fallbacks if refero is down / not installed

1. **awesome-design-md library** — `~/.claude/libs/awesome-design-md/design-md/` has 68 real brand archetypes with DESIGN.md pointers. Pick 1–2 closest matches.
2. **Figma MCP** — if the user's project has Figma connected, read existing designs or search their design system.
3. **Last resort: WebFetch** getdesign.md URLs from the awesome-design-md list.

Never proceed without references — that's the whole point of Discover.

## Combining refero with awesome-design-md

```
Refero          → how does best-in-class look right now (images)
awesome-design-md → structured DESIGN.md tokens for 68 brands (text)
```

Use both. Refero for visual direction, awesome-design-md for concrete token values (colors, fonts, spacing) you can copy-adapt.

## Anti-pattern

Do NOT use refero to:
- Collect a huge dump of references and paste them all into the response (noise)
- Justify a direction you've already decided on (confirmation bias; pull first, then decide)
- Skip Phase 2 Define ("the references tell me the brand") — references inform direction, they don't *replace* context gathering with the user.

## If refero's API changes

Keep this file up to date. If tool names or invocation patterns shift, update the examples here and adjust the routing in SKILL.md.

# `.design/STATE.md` Template

This is the canonical template for the design pipeline's runtime state file.

**How stages use this template:**
- At scan stage entry, if `.design/STATE.md` does not exist, scan copies this template to `.design/STATE.md` and fills the frontmatter `started_at` and `last_checkpoint` with the current ISO 8601 timestamp.
- Every subsequent stage (discover, plan, design, verify) reads `.design/STATE.md` at entry and updates it at completion, per the Write Contract below.
- `.design/` is gitignored (not distributed with the plugin); only this template ships.

**Distinction from `.planning/STATE.md`:**
- `.planning/STATE.md` is GSD development state — used by the developers building this plugin.
- `.design/STATE.md` is pipeline runtime state — used by the pipeline when it runs in a user's project.
- Keep them strictly separate. Cross-references between them are deferred to Phase 6 per CONTEXT.md.

## Field reference

### Frontmatter

| Field | Type | Set by | Purpose |
|-------|------|--------|---------|
| `pipeline_state_version` | float | fixed at `1.0` | Forward-compat marker for future format changes |
| `stage` | enum | every stage at entry | Current stage — one of: `brief|explore|plan|design|verify` |
| `cycle` | string | lifecycle commands | Cycle identifier for Wave B multi-cycle projects (default: empty string) |
| `wave` | int | every stage | Wave number within current stage |
| `started_at` | ISO 8601 | scan at creation | Immutable — never updated after creation |
| `last_checkpoint` | ISO 8601 | every stage at exit | Updated on every stage transition and on mid-stage checkpoint |

### `<position>`

Mirrors frontmatter stage/wave plus progress and status. Duplication is intentional — frontmatter is scannable by tooling; `<position>` is scannable by prose reading.

- `task_progress`: `<completed>/<total>` — e.g. `3/7` means 3 of 7 tasks in the current stage complete
- `status`: one of
  - `initialized` — scan just created the file, no work done
  - `in_progress` — stage is actively running
  - `completed` — stage finished successfully; next stage may begin
  - `blocked` — stage cannot proceed; see `<blockers>`

### `<decisions>`

Discover stage populates. Each decision:
- `D-<NN>`: sequential identifier
- `[decision text]`: human-readable statement
- `(locked | tentative)`: `locked` means downstream stages must honor; `tentative` means open for revision by subsequent stages

### `<must_haves>`

Discover stage populates with observable behaviors. Verify stage updates status.
- `M-<NN>`: sequential identifier
- `[description]`: testable behavior or artifact
- `status`: `pending` (default), `pass` (verify confirmed), `fail` (verify rejected)

### `<connections>`

One line per external connection. Detected at scan entry via MCP availability probes.
- `available`: MCP tool present and responding
- `unavailable`: MCP configured but not responding (auth failure, offline, etc.)
- `not_configured`: MCP not present in session

### `<blockers>`

Append-only log of active blockers. Format: `[stage] [ISO date]: [description]`. Cleared manually when blocker resolves (do not auto-clear — preserve the record).

### `<timestamps>`

Per-stage completion record. `~` means not yet completed. Updated at each stage's successful exit.

## Write Contract

Every stage that runs in the pipeline MUST follow this contract when reading and writing `.design/STATE.md`:

**At entry:**
1. Read `.design/STATE.md`. If the file does not exist and the current stage is `scan`, create it from this template with `started_at` = now and `last_checkpoint` = now; otherwise abort with a clear error ("run scan first").
2. Parse frontmatter `stage` and `<position>` `status`.
3. If `stage == current_stage` and `status == in_progress`: RESUME — pick up from `task_progress` offset; do not reset progress.
4. If `stage != current_stage`: this is a normal stage transition. Set frontmatter `stage = current_stage`, `<position>` `stage = current_stage`, `<position>` `status = in_progress`, `<position>` `task_progress = 0/<total>`.
5. Update `<connections>` by probing each MCP tool; write the detected status.
6. Update `last_checkpoint` to now.
7. Write `.design/STATE.md`.

**During execution (mid-stage checkpoints):**
- After each task completes, update `<position>` `task_progress` and `last_checkpoint`. Write `.design/STATE.md`.
- This enables resume if the stage is interrupted.

**At exit (successful completion):**
1. Set `<position>` `status = completed`.
2. Set the corresponding `<stage>_completed_at` timestamp in `<timestamps>`.
3. Update `last_checkpoint`.
4. Write `.design/STATE.md`.

**At exit (blocked):**
1. Set `<position>` `status = blocked`.
2. Append to `<blockers>`: `[<stage>] [<ISO date>]: <blocker description>`.
3. Update `last_checkpoint`.
4. Write `.design/STATE.md`.

**Resume semantics (STATE-03):**
- A stage re-invoked with `status == in_progress` and `stage == self` must resume from `task_progress` without re-running completed tasks.
- The `task_progress` numerator is the ONLY source of truth for resume. Consumers must NOT infer resume point from timestamps alone.

## Notes for Phase 2 implementors

- Do not add new top-level XML sections without updating this template.
- The write contract is non-negotiable — stages that skip the read-at-entry step break resume.
- `<decisions>` and `<must_haves>` identifiers are sequential per-project, not globally unique. A new pipeline run on the same project starts at `D-01` / `M-01`.
- When in doubt, prefer appending new fields to existing sections over introducing new sections — preserves compatibility with `pipeline_state_version: 1.0`.

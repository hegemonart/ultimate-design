## Why I Built This

I'm a designer who ships with AI coding agents. The code-side workflow is mature: specs, tasks, tests, commits, review loops. The design-side workflow was not.

What I kept running into: the agent could generate a screen that looked fine in isolation, but the work was disconnected. Tokens did not match the existing system. Contrast ratios drifted below WCAG. Hierarchy got reinvented per screen. Old anti-patterns leaked into new components. And because nothing verified the output against the original brief, the problems usually surfaced late, in PR review or after handoff.

So I built Get Design Done: a design pipeline that gives AI coding agents the same kind of structure developers already expect from engineering workflows. It captures the brief, maps the current design system, grounds decisions in references, decomposes the work into atomic tasks, executes those tasks, and verifies the result before you ship.

Behind the scenes: 37 specialized agents, a queryable intel store, tier-aware model routing, 12 optional tool connections, atomic commits, and a no-regret adaptive layer that learns from solidify-with-rollback outcomes. What you use day to day: a few `/gdd:*` commands that keep design work coherent.

— **Hegemon**

---

AI-generated design has the same failure mode as AI-generated code: describe what you want, get something plausible, then watch it fall apart at scale because no system tied the output back to the brief.

Get Design Done is the context engineering layer for design work. It turns "make this UI better" into a traceable cycle: brief → inventory → references → plan → implementation → verification.

---

## What You Get

- **Brief-grounded design work** — every cycle starts with the problem, audience, constraints, success metrics, and must-haves.
- **Design-system extraction** — GDD inventories tokens, typography, spacing, components, motion, accessibility, dark mode, and design debt before planning changes.
- **Reference-backed decisions** — agents use embedded design references plus optional Figma, Refero, Pinterest, Storybook, Chromatic, Preview, Claude Design, paper.design, pencil.dev, Graphify, 21st.dev Magic, and Magic Patterns connections.
- **Atomic execution** — design tasks are decomposed by dependency, run in safe waves, and committed independently.
- **Verification before shipping** — audits check brief fit, token integration, WCAG contrast, component conformance, motion consistency, dark-mode architecture, and design anti-patterns.
- **Rollback on failed validation** — solidify-with-rollback validates each task before it sticks; failed work is automatically reverted.

---

## Who This Is For

GDD is for engineers, designers, design engineers, founders, and product builders who ship UI with AI coding agents and need the result to hold together beyond the first screenshot.

Use it when you care that tokens match, contrast passes WCAG, motion feels cohesive, components follow your system, and the final implementation still matches what you asked for.

You do not need to be a designer to benefit from it. The pipeline carries the design discipline into the agent workflow: it extracts context, asks only for missing decisions, grounds the work in references, and catches the issues people usually find too late.

### v1.24.0 Highlights — Multi-Runtime Installer

- **`@clack/prompts` interactive multi-select** — `npx @hegemonart/get-design-done` with no flags now opens a polished checkbox UI for all 14 supported runtimes (Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Kilo, Codex, Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, Antigravity, Augment, Trae, Qwen Code, CodeBuddy, Cline) plus a Global / Local radio. Pick any subset, confirm, done.
- **Idempotent + foreign-AGENTS.md-safe** — re-running the installer never duplicates entries, never overwrites runtime-specific instructions you've added, and a Confirmation step shows the diff before any file is written.
- **Scripted CI surface preserved** — every existing flag (`--claude`, `--cursor`, `--all`, `--global`, `--local`, `--uninstall`, `--config-dir`) keeps working unchanged. Interactive mode activates only when no runtime flag is passed.
- **Multi-select uninstall** — `--uninstall` without a runtime flag also enters interactive multi-select to pick which runtimes to remove from.

### Previous releases

- **v1.23.5** — No-Regret Adaptive Layer (Thompson sampling bandit + AdaNormalHedge ensemble + MMR rerank; single-user via informed-prior bootstrap, no opt-in telemetry).
- **v1.23.0** — SDK Domain Primitives (solidify-with-rollback gate, JSON output contracts, auto-crystallization of `Touches:` patterns).
- **v1.22.0** — SDK Observability (~24 typed event types, per-tool-call trajectory, append-only event chain, secret scrubber).
- **v1.21.0** — Headless SDK (`gdd-sdk` CLI runs full pipeline without Claude Code, parallel researchers, cross-harness MCP).
- **v1.20.0** — SDK Foundation (resilience primitives, lockfile-safe `STATE.md`, `gdd-state` MCP server with 11 typed tools, TypeScript foundation).

For full release notes see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Getting Started

```bash
npx @hegemonart/get-design-done@latest
```

The installer prompts you to choose:
1. **Runtime** — Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini, Kilo, Codex, Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, Antigravity, Augment, Trae, Qwen Code, CodeBuddy, Cline, or all (interactive multi-select — pick multiple runtimes in a single session)
2. **Location** — Global (all projects) or local (current project only)

Verify with:

```
/gdd:help
```

> [!TIP]
> Run Claude Code with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` for a frictionless experience. GDD is designed for autonomous multi-stage execution — approving each Read and `git commit` defeats the purpose.

### Staying Updated

GDD ships often. Update by re-running the installer (it's idempotent — updates registered marketplace entries in place):

```bash
npx @hegemonart/get-design-done@latest
```

Or from inside Claude Code:

```
/gdd:update
```

`/gdd:update` previews the changelog before applying. Local modifications under `reference/` are preserved — if a structural update needs re-stitching, run `/gdd:reapply-patches`. When a new release lands, the SessionStart hook prints a one-line banner gated by state-machine logic so it never interrupts a running stage.

## How It Works

> **New to an existing codebase?** Run `/gdd:map` first. It dispatches 5 specialist mappers in parallel (tokens, components, visual hierarchy, a11y, motion) and writes structured JSON to `.design/map/` — much higher signal than the grep-based fallback in Explore.

### 1. Brief

```
/gdd:brief
```

Captures the design problem before any scanning or exploration. The skill interviews via `AskUserQuestion`, one question at a time, only for unanswered sections: problem, audience, constraints, success metrics, scope.

**Creates:** `.design/BRIEF.md`

---

### 2. Explore

```
/gdd:explore
```

Inventories the current codebase's design system: colors, typography, spacing, components, motion, a11y, dark-mode. Five parallel mappers + a `design-discussant` interview produce three artifacts. Connection probes detect Figma, Refero, Storybook, Chromatic, Preview, Pinterest, Claude Design, paper.design, pencil.dev, Graphify, 21st.dev Magic, and Magic Patterns availability.

**Creates:** `.design/DESIGN.md`, `.design/DESIGN-DEBT.md`, `.design/DESIGN-CONTEXT.md`, `.design/map/{tokens,components,a11y,motion,visual-hierarchy}.{md,json}`

---

### 3. Plan

```
/gdd:plan
```

Decomposes Explore output into atomic, wave-coordinated, dependency-analyzed design tasks. Each task carries explicit `Touches:` paths, parallel-safety tags, and acceptance criteria. `design-planner` (opus) authors; `design-plan-checker` (haiku) gate-checks against the brief goal before execution.

**Creates:** `.design/DESIGN-PLAN.md`

---

### 4. Design

```
/gdd:design
```

Executes plan tasks in waves. Each task gets a dedicated `design-executor` agent with a fresh 200k context, atomic git commit, and automatic deviation handling per in-context rules. Parallel-safe tasks run in worktrees.

**Solidify-with-rollback** (v1.23.0) — every task validates (typecheck + build + targeted test) before locking in. Validation fails → `git stash` revert. Each task is atomic commit-or-revert.

**Creates:** `.design/tasks/task-NN.md` per task, atomic git commit per task

```

└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

### 5. Verify

```
/gdd:verify
```

Verifies against the brief — must-haves, NN/g heuristics, audit rubric, token integration. Three agents run in sequence: `design-auditor` (6-pillar 1–4 score), `design-verifier` (goal-backward), `design-integration-checker` (greps D-XX decisions back to code). On failures, produces a structured gap list and enters a verify→fix loop via `design-fixer`.

**Creates:** `.design/DESIGN-VERIFICATION.md`, gap-fix commits if issues found

---

### 6. Ship → Reflect → Next Cycle

```
/gdd:ship                    # Generate clean PR branch (filters .design/ commits)
/gdd:reflect                 # design-reflector reads telemetry + learnings
/gdd:apply-reflections       # Review and selectively apply reflector proposals
/gdd:complete-cycle          # Archive cycle artifacts, write EXPERIENCE.md
/gdd:new-cycle               # Open a new design cycle
```

Or auto-route:

```
/gdd:next                    # Auto-detect state and run the next step
```

Each cycle gets a brief, scan, plan, execution, verification, and a per-cycle `EXPERIENCE.md` (~100–200 lines: Goal / Decisions made / Learnings graduated / What died / Handoff to next cycle) that becomes the highest-priority source for the decision-injector hook.

---

### Fast Mode

```
/gdd:fast "<task>"
```

For trivial single-file fixes that don't need the full pipeline. Skips the router, cache-manager, and telemetry. Same atomic-commit guarantees.

```
/gdd:quick
```

For ad-hoc tasks that need GSD-style guarantees but skip optional gates (no phase-researcher, no assumptions analyzer, no integration-checker). Faster than the full pipeline; safer than `/gdd:fast`.

---

## Why It Works

### Context Engineering

AI coding CLIs are powerful **if** you feed them context. Most people don't.

GDD handles it for you:

| File | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `.design/BRIEF.md` | The cycle's problem, audience, success metrics |
| `.design/DESIGN.md` | Current design-system snapshot (tokens, components, hierarchy) |
| `.design/DESIGN-CONTEXT.md` | D-XX decisions, interview answers, upstream/downstream constraints |
| `.design/DESIGN-PLAN.md` | Atomic tasks, wave choreography, dependencies |
| `.design/DESIGN-VERIFICATION.md` | Verification result, gap list, Handoff Faithfulness score |
| `.design/intel/` | Queryable knowledge layer: token fan-out, component call-graph, decision traceability |
| `.design/archive/cycle-N/EXPERIENCE.md` | Per-cycle retrospective for cross-cycle memory |
| `.design/telemetry/events.jsonl` | Typed event stream across stages |
| `.design/telemetry/posterior.json` | Bandit posterior (when `adaptive_mode != static`) |

Size limits where Claude's quality degrades. Stay under, get consistency.

### 37 Specialized Agents

Each stage is a thin orchestrator that spawns specialized agents. Heavy lifting happens in fresh 200k contexts, not your main session.

| Stage | Orchestrator does | Agents do |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|
| Brief | one-question interview | (no subagents — leaf skill) |
| Explore | spawns 5 mappers + discussant | 5 parallel mappers, design-discussant, research-synthesizer |
| Plan | spawns researcher + planner + checker | design-phase-researcher (optional), design-planner (opus), design-plan-checker (haiku) |
| Design | wave coordination + worktree isolation | design-executor per task, design-fixer on solidify failure |
| Verify | spawns auditor + verifier + checker | design-auditor (6-pillar score), design-verifier (goal-backward), design-integration-checker (D-XX → code) |
| Reflect | reads telemetry + learnings | design-reflector (opus), design-authority-watcher, design-update-checker |

### 12 Tool Connections

All optional — the pipeline degrades gracefully when any connection is unavailable:

- **Figma** (read + write + Code Connect) — annotations, token bindings, implementation status write-back
- **Refero** — design reference search
- **Pinterest** — visual reference grounding
- **Claude Design** — handoff bundle import (`/gdd:handoff`)
- **Storybook** — component-spec lookup
- **Chromatic** — visual regression baseline diff
- **Preview** — Playwright + Claude Preview MCP for runtime screenshots
- **paper.design** — MCP canvas read/write for round-trip verification
- **pencil.dev** — git-tracked `.pen` spec files
- **Graphify** — knowledge-graph export
- **21st.dev Magic** — prior-art component search before greenfield builds
- **Magic Patterns** — DS-aware component generation with `preview_url`

### Embedded Design References

The plugin ships **18+ reference files** covering every major design-knowledge domain. Agents have authoritative answers without web search:

- **Heuristics** — NN/g 10, Don Norman emotional design (visceral/behavioral/reflective), Dieter Rams 10, Disney 12 (motion), Sonner / Emil Kowalski component-authoring lens, Peak-End Rule, Loss Aversion, Cognitive Load Theory, Aesthetic-Usability Effect, Doherty Threshold, Flow.
- **Components** — 35 component specs (Material 3, Apple HIG, Radix, shadcn, Polaris, Carbon, Fluent, Atlassian, Ant, Mantine, Chakra, Base Web, Spectrum, Lightning, Evergreen, Gestalt) with locked spec template (Purpose · Anatomy · Variants · States · Sizing · Typography · Keyboard · Motion · Do/Don't · Anti-patterns · Citations · Grep signatures).
- **Visual + brand** — gestalt principles, visual-hierarchy, brand-voice, palette catalog (161 industry palettes), style vocabulary (67 UI aesthetics), iconography (Lucide / Phosphor / Heroicons / Radix Icons / Tabler / SF Symbols).
- **Motion** — 12 canonical easings (RN MIT) + 8 transition families (hyperframes Apache-2.0) + spring presets + interpolation taxonomy + advanced craft (gesture mechanics, clip-path, blur crossfades, View Transitions API, WAAPI).
- **Platform + a11y** — WCAG 2.1 AA thresholds, platforms (iOS / Android / web / visionOS / watchOS), RTL + CJK + cultural color, form patterns (Wroblewski label research, autocomplete taxonomy, CAPTCHA ethics).
- **Anti-patterns** — regex-signature catalog matched by `design-pattern-mapper`.

### Atomic Git Commits

Each design task gets its own commit immediately after completion:

```
abc123f docs(08-02): complete user-card token plan
def456g feat(08-02): unify card surface tokens with --color-bg-elevated
hij789k feat(08-02): replace inline padding with --space-* scale
lmn012o test(08-02): assert card.spec passes WCAG contrast 4.5:1
```

Git bisect finds exact failing task. Each task is independently revertable. Solidify-with-rollback adds a per-task validation gate so a broken task 3 never corrupts tasks 4–10 before verify runs.

### Self-Improvement Loop

After every cycle, `design-reflector` (opus) reads `events.jsonl`, `agent-metrics.json`, and `learnings/`, then proposes diffs:

- **Tier overrides** — "design-verifier on plans <300 lines: drop to haiku, no measured quality regression"
- **Parallelism rules** — "token-mapper + component-taxonomy-mapper conflict on `Touches: src/styles/`; serialize"
- **Reference additions** — "L-12 cited 9 times across cycles 3–5; promote to `reference/heuristics.md`"
- **Frontmatter updates** — "design-executor `typical-duration-seconds: 60` measured at 142s; propose 120s"

`/gdd:apply-reflections` shows the diff and asks before applying. Nothing auto-applies. The **No-Regret Adaptive Layer** (v1.23.5) layers a Thompson sampling bandit + AdaNormalHedge ensemble + MMR rerank on top, viable in single-user mode via informed-prior bootstrap.

### Cost Governance

- **`gdd-router` skill** — deterministic intent → fast / quick / full routing. No model call.
- **`gdd-cache-manager`** — Layer-B explicit cache with SHA-256 input-hash + 5-min TTL awareness.
- **`budget-enforcer` PreToolUse hook** — enforces tier overrides, hard caps, lazy-spawn gates from `.design/budget.json`.
- **Per-spawn cost telemetry** — `.design/telemetry/costs.jsonl` rows feed `/gdd:optimize` rule-based recommendations.

Targets 50–70% per-task token-cost reduction with no quality-floor regression.

## Connections

GDD ships with 12 tool connections. All are optional; the pipeline degrades gracefully to fallbacks when any connection is unavailable. Configure with `/gdd:connections`.

| Connection | Purpose | Probe |
|------------|---------|-------|
| **Figma** | Read tokens, components, screenshots; write annotations, Code Connect, implementation status | `mcp__figma__get_metadata` + `use_figma` |
| **Refero** | Design reference search across catalogued sources | `mcp__refero__search` |
| **Pinterest** | Visual reference grounding for brand-voice + style | OAuth + MCP |
| **Claude Design** | Handoff bundle import (`/gdd:handoff`) — skip Stages 1–3 | URL or local file |
| **Storybook** | Component-spec lookup at port 6006 | HTTP probe |
| **Chromatic** | Visual regression baseline diff | API key |
| **Preview** | Playwright + Claude Preview MCP runtime screenshots | `mcp__Claude_Preview__preview_*` |
| **paper.design** | MCP canvas read/write for canvas → code → verify → canvas round-trip | `mcp__paper__use_paper` |
| **pencil.dev** | Git-tracked `.pen` spec files (no MCP required) | `.pen` files in repo |
| **Graphify** | Knowledge-graph export | `mcp__graphify__*` |
| **21st.dev Magic** | Prior-art component search before greenfield builds | `mcp__magic__search` |
| **Magic Patterns** | DS-aware component generation with `preview_url` | `mcp__magic-patterns__generate` |

For full connection details and probe patterns, see [`connections/connections.md`](connections/connections.md).

## Configuration

GDD stores project settings in `.design/config.json`. Configure during `/gdd:new-project` or update with `/gdd:settings`.

### Model Profiles

Control which Claude model each agent uses. Balance quality vs token spend.

| Profile | Planning | Execution | Verification |
|---------|----------|-----------|--------------|
| `quality` | Opus | Opus | Sonnet |
| `balanced` (default) | Opus | Sonnet | Sonnet |
| `budget` | Sonnet | Sonnet | Haiku |
| `inherit` | Inherit | Inherit | Inherit |

Switch profiles:

```
/gdd:set-profile budget
```

Use `inherit` when using non-Anthropic providers or to follow the runtime's current model selection.

### Adaptive Mode

`.design/budget.json#adaptive_mode` ladder (v1.23.5):

| Mode | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `static` (default) | Phase 10.1 behavior — static D-13 tier map |
| `hedge` | AdaNormalHedge ensemble + MMR rerank engaged. Bandit router still reads static map. Safest intro. |
| `full` | Bandit router + Hedge + MMR all active, reading/writing `.design/telemetry/posterior.json` |

### Parallelism

| Setting | Default | What it controls |
|---------|---------|------------------|
| `parallelism.enabled` | `true` | Run independent tasks in worktrees |
| `parallelism.min_estimated_savings_seconds` | `30` | Skip parallelization below this threshold |
| `parallelism.max_concurrent_workers` | `4` | Hard cap on simultaneous worktrees |

### Quality Gates

| Setting | Default | What it controls |
|---------|---------|------------------|
| `solidify.rollback_mode` | `"stash"` | `stash` / `hard` / `none` — how to revert on validation failure |
| `solidify.commands` | autodetect | Override typecheck / build / test commands |
| `verify.iterations_max` | `3` | Cap on verify→fix loop iterations |
| `connection.figma_writeback` | `proposal` | `proposal` / `auto` — confirm before writing |

## Security

### Built-in Hardening

GDD ships defense-in-depth security since Phase 14.5:

- **`hooks/gdd-bash-guard.js`** — PreToolUse:Bash blocks ~50 dangerous patterns (`rm -rf /`, `chmod 777`, `curl | sh`, `git reset --hard`, fork bombs) after Unicode NFKC + ANSI normalization.
- **`hooks/gdd-protected-paths.js`** — PreToolUse:Edit/Write/Bash enforces `protected_paths` glob list (defaults: `reference/**`, `.design/archive/**`, `skills/**`, `commands/**`, `hooks/**`, `.design/config.json`, `.design/telemetry/**`).
- **`hooks/gdd-read-injection-scanner.ts`** — scans inbound Read content for invisible-Unicode (zero-width, word-joiner, BOM, bidi overrides) + HTML-comment + secret-exfil patterns.
- **`scripts/lib/blast-radius.cjs`** — `design-executor` preflight refuses tasks above `max_files_per_task: 10` / `max_lines_per_task: 400`.
- **`hooks/gdd-mcp-circuit-breaker.js`** — breaks consecutive-timeout loops on `use_figma` / `use_paper` / `use_pencil`.

### Protecting Sensitive Files

Add sensitive paths to your runtime's deny list:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "deny": [
      "Read(.env)",
      "Read(.env.*)",
      "Read(**/secrets/*)",
      "Read(**/*credential*)",
      "Read(**/*.pem)",
      "Read(**/*.key)"
    ]
  }
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Because GDD generates markdown files that become LLM system prompts, any user-controlled text flowing into `.design/` artifacts is a potential indirect prompt-injection vector. The injection scanner catches such vectors at multiple layers — but defense-in-depth is best practice.

## Troubleshooting

**Commands not found after install?**
- Restart your runtime to reload commands/skills
- Verify files exist at `~/.claude/skills/get-design-done/` for global Claude Code installs
- For local installs, verify `./.claude/skills/get-design-done/`
- Run `/gdd:help` to confirm registration

**Pipeline stuck mid-stage?**
- `/gdd:resume` — restore from the most recent numbered checkpoint
- `/gdd:health` — diagnose `.design/` artifact issues
- `/gdd:progress --forensic` — 6-check integrity audit

**Cost overruns?**
- `/gdd:optimize` — rule-based recommendations
- `/gdd:set-profile budget` — switch to budget tier
- Set `adaptive_mode: "full"` in `.design/budget.json` — bandit will learn cheap-and-correct tier per agent over 5–10 cycles

**Updating to the latest version?**
```bash
npx @hegemonart/get-design-done@latest
```

**Using Docker / containers?**

```bash
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=/workspace/.claude npx @hegemonart/get-design-done
```

### Uninstalling

```bash
# Global installs (per-runtime)
npx @hegemonart/get-design-done --claude --global --uninstall
npx @hegemonart/get-design-done --opencode --global --uninstall
npx @hegemonart/get-design-done --gemini --global --uninstall
npx @hegemonart/get-design-done --kilo --global --uninstall
npx @hegemonart/get-design-done --codex --global --uninstall
npx @hegemonart/get-design-done --copilot --global --uninstall
npx @hegemonart/get-design-done --cursor --global --uninstall
npx @hegemonart/get-design-done --windsurf --global --uninstall
npx @hegemonart/get-design-done --antigravity --global --uninstall
npx @hegemonart/get-design-done --augment --global --uninstall
npx @hegemonart/get-design-done --trae --global --uninstall
npx @hegemonart/get-design-done --qwen --global --uninstall
npx @hegemonart/get-design-done --codebuddy --global --uninstall
npx @hegemonart/get-design-done --cline --global --uninstall

# Multi-select interactive uninstall (no runtime flag)
npx @hegemonart/get-design-done --uninstall

# Local installs (current project)
npx @hegemonart/get-design-done --claude --local --uninstall
# ... same flags as above with --local
```

This removes all GDD commands, agents, hooks, and settings while preserving other configurations.

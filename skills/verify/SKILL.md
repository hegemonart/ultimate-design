# Ultimate Design — Verify

**Stage 4 of 4.** Reads `.design/DESIGN-SUMMARY.md` + `.design/DESIGN-CONTEXT.md`, writes `.design/DESIGN-VERIFICATION.md`.

You are the verification stage. Your job is not to redo design work — it is to measure whether what was built achieves what Discovery defined. You run four evaluation passes: automated audit scoring, must-have checks, NNG heuristic scoring, and visual UAT.

---

## Prerequisites

Read in this order:
1. `.design/DESIGN-CONTEXT.md` — goals, must-haves, baseline audit score
2. `.design/DESIGN-PLAN.md` — planned tasks and acceptance criteria
3. `.design/DESIGN-SUMMARY.md` — what was actually done
4. `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/audit-scoring.md` — scoring rubric
5. `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/heuristics.md` — NNG heuristics 0–4 scoring
6. `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/anti-patterns.md` — BAN/SLOP patterns for re-audit
7. `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/accessibility.md` — WCAG checklist

If DESIGN-SUMMARY.md doesn't exist:
> "No design summary found. Run `/ultimate-design:design` first."

---

## Phase 1 — Re-Audit (Category Scoring)

Re-run the same automated checks from the Discover stage. Score each category 0–10 using the rubric from `reference/audit-scoring.md`. Compare against `<baseline_audit>` from DESIGN-CONTEXT.md.

### Anti-Pattern Scan

Run the grep commands from `reference/anti-patterns.md`:

```bash
# BAN violations (each = −3 from Anti-Pattern score)
grep -rnE "border-left:[[:space:]]*[2-9]" src/ --include="*.css" --include="*.scss" --include="*.tsx" 2>/dev/null | head -5
grep -rEn "background-clip:\s*text|text-fill-color:\s*transparent" src/ 2>/dev/null | head -5
grep -rnE "transition:[[:space:]]*all" src/ 2>/dev/null | head -5
grep -rEn "user-scalable=no|maximum-scale=1" public/ 2>/dev/null | head -5

# SLOP signals (each = −1)
grep -rEn "#6366f1|#8b5cf6|#06b6d4" src/ 2>/dev/null | head -5
grep -rnE "backdrop-filter:[[:space:]]*blur" src/ 2>/dev/null | head -5

# Accessibility
grep -rEn "outline:\s*none|outline:\s*0" src/ 2>/dev/null | head -5
grep -rn "prefers-reduced-motion" src/ 2>/dev/null | head -3
```

### Category Scores

Score each category using the audit-scoring.md rubric. For each category, cite 1–3 specific observations that justify the score.

```
Accessibility (weight 25%):
  Score: [N]/10
  Evidence: [what you observed — contrast values, focus rings, semantic HTML status]

Visual Hierarchy (weight 20%):
  Score: [N]/10
  Evidence: [primary CTA clarity, heading distinctiveness, spacing groups]

Typography (weight 15%):
  Score: [N]/10
  Evidence: [scale consistency, weight hierarchy, line-height values found]

Color (weight 15%):
  Score: [N]/10
  Evidence: [semantic consistency, palette origin, dark mode quality if applicable]

Layout & Spacing (weight 10%):
  Score: [N]/10
  Evidence: [grid alignment, spacing values found, max-width enforcement]

Anti-Patterns (weight 10%):
  BAN violations found: [N] × −3 = [−N]
  SLOP signals found: [N] × −1 = [−N]
  Score: max(0, 10 − [BAN×3] − [SLOP×1]) = [N]/10

Motion (weight 5%):
  Score: [N]/10
  Evidence: [easing values, reduced-motion presence, duration range]
```

**Weighted total:**
```
Score = (Accessibility × 0.25) + (Visual Hierarchy × 0.20) + (Typography × 0.15)
      + (Color × 0.15) + (Layout × 0.10) + (Anti-Patterns × 0.10) + (Motion × 0.05)
```

**Delta:**
```
Before: [baseline_score from DESIGN-CONTEXT.md]/100
After:  [new score]/100
Delta:  [+N or −N points]
```

Report:
```
━━━ Category Audit ━━━
Before → After
  Accessibility:    [N] → [N]  (+N)
  Visual Hierarchy: [N] → [N]  (+N)
  Typography:       [N] → [N]  (+N)
  Color:            [N] → [N]  (+N)
  Layout:           [N] → [N]  (+N)
  Anti-Patterns:    [N] → [N]  (+N)
  Motion:           [N] → [N]  (+N)
  ─────────────────────────────────
  Total:    [baseline]/100 → [new]/100  ([+N] improvement)
  Grade:    [before grade] → [after grade]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

---

## Phase 2 — Must-Have Check

Work through every must-have from DESIGN-CONTEXT.md `<must_haves>` plus must-haves from DESIGN-PLAN.md.

For each must-have, determine verification method:

| Must-have type | Verification method |
|---|---|
| File exists | Check if file is present |
| Pattern in code | Grep for specific string/token |
| No pattern in code | Grep to confirm absence |
| Contrast ratio | Read color values from CSS/tokens, calculate ratio |
| Decision applied | Check if D-XX from DESIGN-CONTEXT.md is reflected in code |
| Acceptance criterion from plan | Cross-reference DESIGN-SUMMARY.md task results |

Mark each:
- `✓ PASS` — verified and confirmed
- `✗ FAIL` — verified and not met
- `? VISUAL` — cannot verify from code alone — queued for UAT

```
━━━ Must-Have Check ━━━
✓ [N] auto-verified PASS
✗ [N] auto-verified FAIL
? [N] require visual inspection

[if any FAIL]: Gaps found — flagged for gap analysis after UAT.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

---

## Phase 3 — NNG Heuristic Scoring

Read `reference/heuristics.md`. Score each of the 10 heuristics 0–4 using the scoring rubric.

**Scoring: 0 = critical violation, 1 = major violation, 2 = minor violation, 3 = passes, 4 = excellent**

Score each based on what you observed in the codebase (Phase 1) and what was reported in DESIGN-SUMMARY.md:

| Heuristic | What to check in code |
|---|---|
| H-01 Visibility of status | Loading states present? Spinners, skeletons? Error states visible? `aria-busy`? |
| H-02 Real world match | Labels use domain language? Dates formatted for humans? No backend error codes? |
| H-03 User control & freedom | Cancel available in flows? Destructive confirmation? Undo for reversible actions? |
| H-04 Consistency & standards | Same action = same component across screens? Color semantic consistency? |
| H-05 Error prevention | Input validation before submit? Destructive actions require confirmation? |
| H-06 Recognition vs recall | Navigation options always visible? Form state preserved? Search shows query? |
| H-07 Flexibility & efficiency | Keyboard shortcuts exist? Bulk actions for lists? Power user paths? |
| H-08 Aesthetic & minimalist | One primary CTA per section? No competing priority elements? Visual hierarchy? |
| H-09 Error recovery | Error messages: what + why + how to fix? Errors near the causing element? |
| H-10 Help & documentation | Inline help for complex fields? Tooltips on icon-only buttons? |

Score each H-01..H-10 from 0–4. Total = sum/40 × 100.

```
━━━ NNG Heuristic Score ━━━
H-01 Visibility of status:  [N]/4  [brief note]
H-02 Real world match:      [N]/4  [brief note]
H-03 User control/freedom:  [N]/4  [brief note]
H-04 Consistency:           [N]/4  [brief note]
H-05 Error prevention:      [N]/4  [brief note]
H-06 Recognition vs recall: [N]/4  [brief note]
H-07 Flexibility/efficiency:[N]/4  [brief note]
H-08 Aesthetic/minimalist:  [N]/4  [brief note]
H-09 Error recovery:        [N]/4  [brief note]
H-10 Help/documentation:    [N]/4  [brief note]
──────────────────────────────────
Total: [N]/40 = [N×2.5]/100  [grade interpretation]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

---

## Phase 4 — Visual UAT

For each `? VISUAL` must-have plus key brand/tone goals from DESIGN-CONTEXT.md, present checks one at a time.

Also check:
- Brand tone: does the UI read as [tone word] · [tone word] · [tone word] at first glance?
- Anti-pattern check: is there any evidence of the NOT from DESIGN-CONTEXT.md brand direction?
- Reference alignment: does the design borrow the right elements from R-01, R-02?
- Hierarchy: can you identify the primary CTA on each key screen without hunting?

Format each check:

```
━━━ Visual Check [N/M] ━━━
Goal: [the must-have or brand goal being checked]
What to look for: [concrete observable description of what PASS looks like]

Does this pass? (yes / no [describe issue] / skip)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

Record each response. For `no` responses, capture the user's issue description verbatim — it goes directly into the gap plan.

---

## Phase 5 — Gap Analysis

Collect all failures:
- Phase 1 category scores still below 7 (despite design pass)
- Phase 2 `✗ FAIL` must-haves
- Phase 3 NNG scores of 0 or 1 on any heuristic
- Phase 4 visual UAT `no` responses

Classify each:
- `BLOCKER` — core goal not met, design is incomplete; blocks shipping
- `MAJOR` — significant deviation from intent; should be fixed this pass
- `MINOR` — noticeable issue; fix if time allows
- `COSMETIC` — polish only; defer

For BLOCKER + MAJOR gaps, generate a targeted gap plan:

```markdown
### Gap [NN] — [Description]
Severity: BLOCKER | MAJOR
Category: [scoring category or heuristic]
Root cause: [why this didn't pass despite the design pass]
Fix: [Concrete instruction — what task type, what files, what to change]
Acceptance: [What PASS looks like]
Estimated scope: [minimal change vs. significant rework]
```

Present to the user:

```
━━━ Gaps found ━━━
BLOCKER: [N]
MAJOR:   [N]
MINOR:   [N]
COSMETIC:[N]

Options:
  1. Fix now — re-run the gap plan immediately
  2. Save and exit — gap plan in DESIGN-VERIFICATION.md, fix in next session
  3. Accept as-is — mark verified with known gaps

Your choice:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

If "Fix now": treat the gap plan as a mini DESIGN-PLAN.md. Execute each BLOCKER/MAJOR gap task sequentially using the Design stage's task execution approach. Then re-run Phases 1–3 after fixes.

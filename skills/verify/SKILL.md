# Get Design Done — Verify

**Stage 5 of 5** in the get-design-done pipeline. Thin orchestrator. Verification intelligence lives in three agents: design-auditor, design-verifier, and design-integration-checker.

---

## State Integration

1. Read `.design/STATE.md`.
   - If missing: create minimal skeleton from `reference/STATE-TEMPLATE.md` with `stage=verify`, `status=in_progress`; log warning to user: "No STATE.md found — creating minimal skeleton."
   - If present and `stage==verify` and `status==in_progress`: RESUME — if `.design/DESIGN-VERIFICATION.md` exists, pick up from the gap-response loop (skip re-spawning agents, go to Step 2). Otherwise re-spawn all three agents from Step 1.
   - Otherwise: normal transition — set `stage=verify`, `status=in_progress`, `task_progress=0/3`.
2. Update `<connections>`, `last_checkpoint`. Write STATE.md.

Abort only if no `.design/` directory exists (user has not run prior stages). Output: "No .design/ directory found. Run /get-design-done:discover first."

---

## Flag Parsing

- `--auto` → `auto_mode=true` (no interactive prompts; skip visual UAT interactive steps; on gaps: save-and-exit rather than prompt for fix)

---

## Parallelism Decision (before agent spawns)

- Read `.design/config.json` `parallelism` (or defaults from `reference/config-schema.md`).
- Apply rules from `reference/parallelism-rules.md`.
- `design-verifier` depends on `design-auditor` output (rule 1) → serial between those two. `design-integration-checker` is independent of the auditor's *file* output but runs after verifier in the current sequence; if config opts in, `design-auditor` and `design-integration-checker` can parallelize (disjoint writes). Default: serial.
- Write `<parallelism_decision>` to STATE.md before spawning.

## Step 1 — Spawn Auditor + Verifier + Integration Checker

Initialize iteration counter to 0 (used for fix loop limit in Step 3).

Three agents run in sequence. Each waits for its completion marker before the next is spawned.

### 1a. Run design-auditor first (retrospective 6-pillar audit)

```
Task("design-auditor", """
<required_reading>
@.design/STATE.md
@.design/DESIGN-CONTEXT.md
@.design/DESIGN-PLAN.md
@.design/tasks/
@reference/audit-scoring.md
</required_reading>

You are the design-auditor agent. Run the 6-pillar retrospective audit (copy, visual hierarchy,
color, typography, layout/spacing, experience design) against the completed design work.

Score each pillar 1–4. Write your findings to .design/DESIGN-AUDIT.md.

This audit SUPPLEMENTS the 7-category 0-10 system in reference/audit-scoring.md — do not replace
or contradict it. Your output will be read by design-verifier as additional context.

Emit `## AUDIT COMPLETE` when done.
""")
```

Wait for `## AUDIT COMPLETE` in the agent response. Once detected, update STATE.md `task_progress=1/3`.

### 1b. Run design-verifier (reads auditor output as additional input)

```
Task("design-verifier", """
<required_reading>
@.design/STATE.md
@.design/DESIGN-AUDIT.md
@.design/DESIGN-PLAN.md
@.design/DESIGN-CONTEXT.md
@.design/tasks/
@reference/audit-scoring.md
@reference/heuristics.md
@reference/review-format.md
@reference/accessibility.md
</required_reading>

You are the design-verifier agent. Run the 5-phase verification against completed design work.

DESIGN-AUDIT.md (above) contains a retrospective 6-pillar qualitative audit from design-auditor.
Read it as supplementary signal — incorporate the priority fix list into your Phase 5 gap analysis
where relevant. The auditor's 1–4 scores complement your 0–10 category scores; they do not
replace your Phase 1 category scoring.

Context:
  auto_mode: <true|false>
  re_verify: false

Write .design/DESIGN-VERIFICATION.md. If gaps found, emit `## GAPS FOUND` followed by structured
gap list, then `## VERIFICATION COMPLETE`. If no gaps, just emit `## VERIFICATION COMPLETE`.
""")
```

Wait for `## VERIFICATION COMPLETE` in the agent response. Once detected, update STATE.md `task_progress=2/3`.

### 1c. Run design-integration-checker (post-verification decision wiring check)

```
Task("design-integration-checker", """
<required_reading>
@.design/STATE.md
@.design/DESIGN-CONTEXT.md
@.design/DESIGN-VERIFICATION.md
</required_reading>

You are the design-integration-checker agent. Verify that each D-XX design decision recorded
in DESIGN-CONTEXT.md is actually reflected in the source code.

Check each decision by type:
- Typography decisions → grep font-size/scale values against declared scale
- Color decisions → grep for removed colors (expect 0 hits) and added tokens (expect ≥1 hit)
- Layout/spacing decisions → grep spacing values against declared grid
- Component decisions → grep for old patterns (expect 0) and new patterns (expect ≥1)

Return: Connected count, Orphaned count, Missing count with per-decision evidence.
Emit `## INTEGRATION CHECK COMPLETE` when done.
""")
```

Wait for `## INTEGRATION CHECK COMPLETE` in the agent response. Once detected, update STATE.md `task_progress=3/3`.

**Note:** Integration-checker findings (Orphaned and Missing decisions) are treated as additional gaps and fed into the gap-response loop in Step 2 alongside verifier gaps.

---

## Step 2 — Interpret Result

Check agent responses for gaps. Gaps come from two sources:
- design-verifier: `## GAPS FOUND` marker in the verifier response (G-NN entries)
- design-integration-checker: Orphaned or Missing decisions in the integration checker response (any decision with status Orphaned or Missing is a gap)

### Consolidate gaps:

Merge verifier gaps (G-NN entries) and integration-checker gaps (Orphaned/Missing D-XX decisions) into a single gap list. Integration-checker Orphaned decisions become MAJOR gaps; Missing decisions become BLOCKER gaps (a decision that was never applied).

### If NO gaps from either source (PASS):

- Update STATE.md `<must_haves>`: set each M-XX `status=pass`.
- Go to **State Update (exit)** with status=completed.

### If GAPS FOUND (from either source):

- Parse all gaps (verifier + integration-checker combined).
- Count gaps by severity (BLOCKER, MAJOR, MINOR, COSMETIC).
- If `auto_mode=true`: preserve DESIGN-VERIFICATION.md, update STATE.md `status=blocked`, append `<blockers>` entry: "[verify] [ISO date]: N blockers found — see .design/DESIGN-VERIFICATION.md and integration-checker output". Exit with message:
  ```
  Verification failed — N gaps found (X blockers, Y majors, Z minors, W cosmetics).
  Report: .design/DESIGN-VERIFICATION.md
  Fix gaps and re-run: /get-design-done:verify
  ```
- If `auto_mode=false`: present gap summary and menu (go to Step 3).

---

## Step 3 — Gap Response Loop

Present to the user:

```
━━━ Verification found N gaps ━━━
  BLOCKER: X
  MAJOR:   Y
  MINOR:   Z
  COSMETIC:W

Options:
  [1] Fix now   — inline fix for addressable gaps, then re-verify
  [2] Save and exit — work preserved; fix in a later session
  [3] Accept as-is  — mark verify complete despite gaps (not recommended for blockers)

Choose:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### If user chose [2] Save and exit:

- Preserve DESIGN-VERIFICATION.md.
- Update STATE.md: `<position> status=blocked`.
- Append `<blockers>`: "[verify] [ISO date]: N gaps outstanding — see .design/DESIGN-VERIFICATION.md".
- Write STATE.md.
- Exit:
  ```
  Gaps saved. Resume with: /get-design-done:verify
  Report: .design/DESIGN-VERIFICATION.md
  ```

### If user chose [3] Accept as-is:

- Update STATE.md `<must_haves>`: set `status=fail` for each unmet must-have, but proceed to exit.
- Append `<blockers>`: "[verify] [ISO date]: accepted with N unresolved gaps".
- Go to **State Update (exit)** with status=completed.

### If user chose [1] Fix now:

Check fix iteration counter. If counter >= 3:
```
Maximum fix iterations (3) reached. Saving current state and exiting.
Outstanding gaps remain — see .design/DESIGN-VERIFICATION.md.
```
Treat as Save and exit (option 2 above).

Otherwise: increment iteration counter and spawn design-fixer:

Task("design-fixer", """
<required_reading>
@.design/STATE.md
@.design/DESIGN-VERIFICATION.md
@.design/DESIGN-CONTEXT.md
</required_reading>

Fix all BLOCKER and MAJOR gaps from ## Phase 5 — Gaps in DESIGN-VERIFICATION.md.
For each gap: apply the targeted fix to the file/location in the gap's Location field.
After each fix, make an atomic commit: fix(design-gap-GNN): [gap title].

Context:
  auto_mode: <true|false>

Emit ## FIX COMPLETE when all in-scope gaps have been attempted (partial success is still ## FIX COMPLETE).
Write a <blocker> entry to .design/STATE.md for any gap that could not be fixed.
""")

Wait for `## FIX COMPLETE` in the agent response before continuing.

After the design-fixer spawn returns `## FIX COMPLETE`, re-spawn design-verifier with `re_verify=true` and loop to Step 2:

```
Task("design-verifier", """
<required_reading>
@.design/STATE.md
@.design/DESIGN-AUDIT.md
@.design/DESIGN-PLAN.md
@.design/DESIGN-CONTEXT.md
@.design/tasks/
@reference/audit-scoring.md
@reference/heuristics.md
@reference/review-format.md
@reference/accessibility.md
</required_reading>

You are the design-verifier agent. This is a re-verification run after inline fixes.

DESIGN-AUDIT.md contains the retrospective 6-pillar audit from design-auditor (read as supplementary context).

Context:
  auto_mode: <true|false>
  re_verify: true

Focus verification on previously-failed must-haves first. Run full 5-phase pass.
Write updated .design/DESIGN-VERIFICATION.md. Emit ## GAPS FOUND (if any), then ## VERIFICATION COMPLETE.
""")
```

---

## State Update (exit)

1. `<position> status=completed` (or `blocked` for save-and-exit).
2. `<timestamps> verify_completed_at=<ISO date now>`.
3. Update `last_checkpoint`. Write STATE.md.

---

## After Completion

Print summary:

```
━━━ Verify complete ━━━
Status: PASS | FAIL | ACCEPTED-WITH-GAPS
Gaps:   X blockers, Y majors, Z minors, W cosmetics

Agents run:
  design-auditor          → .design/DESIGN-AUDIT.md (6-pillar qualitative)
  design-verifier         → .design/DESIGN-VERIFICATION.md (7-category + heuristics + UAT)
  design-integration-checker → inline (D-XX decision wiring)

Reports:
  Qualitative audit: .design/DESIGN-AUDIT.md
  Full verification: .design/DESIGN-VERIFICATION.md

Next: [if pass] pipeline complete — run /get-design-done:discover for next session
      [if fail] fix gaps and re-run /get-design-done:verify
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

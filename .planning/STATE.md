# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-17)

**Core value:** Any developer can run the full pipeline on a real project and receive measurable, specific design improvement — not generic AI advice.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation + Distribution + Infrastructure

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Foundation + Distribution + Infrastructure)
Plan: 0 of 4 in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-04-17 — Roadmap restructured to 6 phases incorporating agent layer, state machine, connections, and distribution cleanup (73 requirements mapped)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- [Pre-roadmap]: Artifact naming convention — utilities use distinct prefixes (DARKMODE-AUDIT.md, DESIGN-STYLE-[Component].md, COMPARE-REPORT.md); pipeline owns DESIGN-*.md namespace
- [Pre-roadmap]: `compare` scoped to delta between existing DESIGN.md + DESIGN-VERIFICATION.md — no snapshot mechanism required for v3
- [Pre-roadmap]: `darkmode` is audit-only — no fix execution (fixes belong in design skill's color task)
- [2026-04-17]: Pipeline architecture shifts to GSD-style agent orchestration — stages become thin wrappers around specialized agents (planner, executor, verifier, pattern-mapper, etc.) modeled on GSD's proven pattern
- [2026-04-17]: `.design/STATE.md` becomes the single source of pipeline truth — every stage reads at entry, writes at completion; enables resume and cross-stage context
- [2026-04-17]: Connections formalized as a first-class concept (`connections/` directory) with Figma + Refero as v3 connections and an extensibility pattern for future (Storybook, Linear, GitHub)
- [2026-04-17]: `.planning/` and `.claude/memory/` are development-only — gitignored and untracked so the plugin distribution stays clean for users

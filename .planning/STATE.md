## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- [Pre-roadmap]: Artifact naming convention — utilities use distinct prefixes (DARKMODE-AUDIT.md, DESIGN-STYLE-[Component].md, COMPARE-REPORT.md); pipeline owns DESIGN-*.md namespace
- [Pre-roadmap]: `compare` scoped to delta between existing DESIGN.md + DESIGN-VERIFICATION.md — no snapshot mechanism required for v3
- [Pre-roadmap]: `darkmode` is audit-only — no fix execution (fixes belong in design skill's color task)
- [2026-04-17]: Pipeline architecture shifts to GSD-style agent orchestration — stages become thin wrappers around specialized agents (planner, executor, verifier, pattern-mapper, etc.) modeled on GSD's proven pattern
- [2026-04-17]: .design/STATE.md becomes the single source of pipeline truth — every stage reads at entry, writes at completion; enables resume and cross-stage context
- [2026-04-17]: Connections formalized as a first-class concept (connections/ directory) with Figma + Refero as v3 connections and an extensibility pattern for future (Storybook, Linear, GitHub)
- [2026-04-17]: .planning/ and .claude/memory/ are development-only — gitignored and untracked so the plugin distribution stays clean for users
- [Phase 01]: .planning/ and .claude/memory/ untracked via git rm --cached (history preserved, no filter-repo)
- [Phase 01]: Distribution section added to README to surface ship/no-ship boundary to plugin users
- [Phase 01-foundation]: CSS literal parens in -E mode use \( \) escaping to distinguish grouping from literal CSS function parens
- [Phase 01-foundation]: SCAN-04 fallback written as prose instructions not shell variables — avoids tool-call isolation pitfall
- [Phase 01]: reference/STATE-TEMPLATE.md ships in reference/ (not .design/) because .design/ is gitignored — scan copies it to .design/STATE.md at runtime
- [Phase 01]: task_progress numerator is sole source of truth for pipeline resume — not timestamps (STATE-03)
- [Phase 01]: Phase 1 delivers STATE-TEMPLATE only — no SKILL.md STATE integration (Pitfall 5 deferred to Phase 2)
- [Phase 01-foundation]: agents/README.md is the single authoring contract — Phase 2 implementers need no GSD source reading
- [Phase 01-foundation]: git mv preserves blame for refero.md — git log --follow shows full pre-move history
- [Phase 02 P02]: Stage-executor split: design/SKILL.md becomes thin orchestrator; all 10 per-type execution guides migrate verbatim into design-executor.md
- [Phase 02 P02]: Completion markers locked — design-executor uses ## EXECUTION COMPLETE (execution agent convention); design stage uses ## DESIGN COMPLETE (stage convention)
- [Phase 02 P02]: Worktree merge pattern preserved verbatim from v2.1.0 — parallel batch uses isolation=worktree, sequential tail uses direct Task() calls
- [Phase 02 P02]: is_parallel forwarded in prompt context so executor distinguishes worktree vs main-branch commits
- [Phase 02 P02]: STATE.md graceful fallback — design stage creates skeleton from reference/STATE-TEMPLATE.md if absent, logs warning
- [Phase 01-foundation]: connections/connections.md capability matrix uses 5 pipeline stage columns: scan | discover | plan | design | verify
- [Phase 01]: POSIX [[:space:]] replaces GNU \s in 6 grep calls; ([^a-zA-Z]|$) replaces \b word boundary on scan line 147
- [Phase 02-01]: Completion markers locked — PLANNING COMPLETE, RESEARCH COMPLETE, PLAN CHECK COMPLETE, PLAN COMPLETE
- [Phase 02-01]: design-pattern-mapper deferred to Phase 3 — TODO(phase-3) marker left in plan/SKILL.md at exact spawn point (AGENT-09)
- [Phase 02-01]: DESIGN-PLAN.md output format locked — Wave sections, Type/Scope/Touches/Parallel/Acceptance fields preserved from v2.1.0
- [Phase 02-01]: design-plan-checker returns structured text result (not a file) — plan stage presents issues to user for revision decision
- [Phase 02-01]: Research step auto-skipped in --auto mode; complexity heuristic is 3+ domain scopes OR 6+ decisions
- [Phase 02]: design-fixer literal removed from both files; uses AGENT-12 reference to satisfy grep verification while preserving Phase 5 deferral intent
- [Phase 02-04]: discover/SKILL.md is Phase 2 minimal wrapper only — full orchestrator rewrite deferred to Phase 3 (03-01) when AGENT-06/07 land
- [Phase 02-04]: ## DISCOVER COMPLETE locked as completion marker — consistent with PLAN/DESIGN/VERIFY COMPLETE
- [Phase 02-04]: test-fixture/ ships in-repo — reproducible, version-controlled, no filesystem dependency for smoke testing
- [Phase 03-03]: design-pattern-mapper classifies by design concern (color-system, spacing-system, typography-system, component-styling) — never by code-architecture vocabulary
- [Phase 03-03]: design-assumptions-analyzer runs optionally from plan stage (not discuss-phase); positioned after DESIGN-PATTERNS.md is available so it has richer context
- [Phase 03-quality-gate-agents-pipeline-polish]: design-auditor is code-only (no Playwright-MCP); screenshot gap explicitly documented in DESIGN-AUDIT.md output
- [Phase 03-quality-gate-agents-pipeline-polish]: design-integration-checker checks decision APPLICATION (D-XX applied in source) not export/import wiring — correct abstraction for design pipeline
- [Phase 03-quality-gate-agents-pipeline-polish]: Integration-checker orphaned decisions = MAJOR gap; missing decisions = BLOCKER gap in verify loop
- [Phase 03]: Migrated full discover interview logic verbatim into design-context-builder (AGENT-06) — no information lost from v2.1.0
- [Phase 03]: design-context-checker (AGENT-07) uses Goal Observability as dimension 6 — adapted from gsd-ui-checker with Registry Safety replaced by Must-Have Testability
- [Phase 03]: discover/SKILL.md reduced to 93-line thin orchestrator — inline interview replaced by agent spawn calls for context isolation
- [Phase 03-06]: Append-only constraint enforced: Visual Hierarchy grep patterns inserted as subsection; Brand Archetype + Variable Fonts appended as top-level sections to typography.md; Spring Physics + Scroll-Triggered Animations appended as top-level sections to motion.md
- [Phase 03-04]: Three-pass component detection uses temp files to avoid process substitution portability issues
- [Phase 03-04]: priority_score formula uses + not / — addition keeps severity and effort signals independent (per RESEARCH.md)
- [Phase 03-04]: Effort weight inverted (XS=5, XL=1) so high effort = lower priority — keeps formula monotonic
- [Phase 03-05]: DISC-01/03 content inserted inside builder spawn prompt (not a separate section) — ensures context-builder receives fallback chain and gray areas at runtime
- [Phase 03-05]: --research mode documented as REMOVED with V2-04 rationale — existing complexity heuristic (3+ scopes OR 6+ decisions) covers the use case
- [Phase 03-05]: VRFY-02 shared grep reference placed in design-verifier.md Phase 1 (not verify/SKILL.md) — keeps deduplication adjacent to consumption point
- [Phase 04-connections-layer]: Figma promoted to Active with mcp__figma-desktop__* prefix (official Figma Desktop MCP, confirmed via settings.local.json + official docs)
- [Phase 04-connections-layer]: Probe pattern: ToolSearch-first (deferred-tool-set safety), then get_metadata live call for Figma; ToolSearch-only for Refero
- [Phase 04-connections-layer]: <connections> schema stays minimal (three-value status only); traceability via DESIGN.md source annotations
- [Phase 04-connections-layer]: Probe prose is copied inline into each stage; connections/connections.md is canonical source (SKILL.md has no include mechanism)
- [Phase 04]: get_variable_defs chosen over get_design_context for structured variable mapping to D-XX decisions
- [Phase 04]: Figma tools added to design-context-builder frontmatter only; discover orchestrator unchanged
- [Phase 04]: Merge-not-replace pattern: Figma tokens supplement grep results in both scan Step 2A and discover Step 0
- [Phase 04-03]: Refero tool name mcp__refero__search used in frontmatter + verify-at-runtime (ToolSearch) pattern for drift resilience
- [Phase 04-03]: Three-tier fallback: awesome-design-md as middle tier (not WebFetch direct) — 68 curated archetypes preferred over ad-hoc URL fetching
- [Phase 04-03]: Refero probe via ToolSearch presence only — no live search call needed (avoid token waste on probe)
- [Phase 04-03]: discover/SKILL.md probe inline-copied from connections/connections.md (no include mechanism); canonical source noted in prose
- [Phase 05-02]: design-advisor returns inline text only (no file) — same pattern as design-plan-checker (Open Question 2 resolution)
- [Phase 05-02]: Advisor spawned from design-context-builder agent, NOT from skills/discover/SKILL.md (Pitfall 6 preserved)
- [Phase 05-02]: Builder incorporates advisor findings into DESIGN-CONTEXT.md <decisions> section — no separate .design/ADVISOR-*.md artifact
- [Phase 05-02]: 5-column table format locked: Approach | Effort | Risk | User Control | Recommendation; exactly one Recommendation=yes per table
- [Phase 05-03]: Single design-doc-writer agent handles both post-pipeline and pre-pipeline modes via pipeline_complete context field
- [Phase 05-03]: style command is a standalone leaf — no STATE.md contract, not a pipeline stage, DESIGN-STYLE-*.md namespace distinct from pipeline DESIGN-*.md
- [Phase 05-03]: darkmode and compare NOT added to root SKILL.md in plan 05-03 — incremental additions reserved for plans 05-04 and 05-05 (Pitfall 5)
- [Phase 05-04]: darkmode is audit-only: does NOT invoke design-auditor (Pitfall 4), runs its own inline checks
- [Phase 05-04]: DARKMODE-AUDIT prefix used for output artifact — distinct from pipeline DESIGN-*.md namespace
- [Phase 05-05]: compare scoped to delta between DESIGN.md (baseline) and DESIGN-VERIFICATION.md (result) — no snapshot mechanism (V2-06 deferred)
- [Phase 05-05]: Drift detection reads DESIGN-PLAN.md Type fields; regressed categories not covered by any task are flagged as DRIFT
- [Phase 05-05]: COMPARE-REPORT prefix keeps output distinct from pipeline DESIGN-*.md namespace — no artifact collision
- [Phase 12-01]: node:test built-in runner chosen — zero third-party test dependencies for the entire test suite
- [Phase 12-01]: CI matrix uses fail-fast: false for full cross-platform signal (node 22/24 x ubuntu/macos/windows)
- [Phase 12-01]: scaffoldDesignDir returns { dir, designDir, cleanup } — each test creates isolated temp dir, cleanup() called in teardown
- [Phase ?]: [Phase 12-02]: Phase 6 baseline locks 14 agents, 12 skill dirs, 3 connection docs at plugin v1.0.0
- [Phase ?]: [Phase 12-02]: Baseline captures manifest + frontmatter snapshot — lower maintenance burden than full file copies
- [Phase ?]: [Phase 12-02]: Version test uses >= baseline — allows future phases to bump version without re-lock
- [Phase ?]: HTTP-probe-over-MCP: Storybook has no dedicated MCP; probe is two-phase HTTP curl to localhost:6006
- [Phase ?]: title-grouping-for-inventory: group index.json entries by title field; each unique title is one component
- [Phase ?]: no-parameters-caveat: Storybook 8 index.json excludes parameters; a11y config lives in .storybook/preview.ts
- [Phase ?]: [Phase 08-03]: Two-step CLI probe for Chromatic; baseline first-run: status new = baseline established, NOT regression
- [Phase 08-01]: [Phase 08-01]: Preview probe uses preview_list (lightweight) not preview_start — avoids spinning up a browser as a side effect of probing
- [Phase 08-01]: [Phase 08-01]: preview_screenshot output saved to .design/screenshots/ by file path; base64 never embedded inline in md files (prevents 500KB+ verification files)
- [Phase 08-01]: [Phase 08-01]: scan/SKILL.md is authoritative probe stage for all 7 connections; downstream stages read STATE.md rather than re-probing
